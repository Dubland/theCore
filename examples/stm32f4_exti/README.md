# The Core _STM32 EXTI_ example

 ```

 target:            stm32f4 Discovery board
 external HW:       UART-to-USB converter attached to the USART3
 toolchain:         GNU arm-none-eabi v.5.2 or greather
 additional SW:     openocd
 ```

_EXTI_ - external interrupt.
According to the [Techopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/7115/external-interrupt):
> An external interrupt is a computer system interrupt that happens as a result
of outside interference, whether thatâ€™s from the user, from peripherals,
from other hardware devices or through a network. These are different
than internal interrupts that happen automatically as the machine
reads through program instructions.

In this application, one particular type of external interrupt is used:
GPIO line interrupt. When voltage level changes on the line (e.g. when button is
pressed), interrupt is generated.

## Wiring

Attach any preferable UART-to-USB converter ([such as this](http://www.geekfactory.mx/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/converdidor_usb_ttl_rs232_pl_2303hx_01.jpg))
module according to following pinout:
```
PD9 (USART RX) - module's TX
PD8 (USART TX) - module's RX
```

Do not forget ground.

## Building

Toolchain is required to build this application. The Core already has one suitable
for this target.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../../toolchains/arm-cm4-gnu.cmake ..
```

## Running

Flash firmware via `openocd` and `gdb`.

1. Attach stm32f4 Discovery board and USB <-> UART converter to the PC.
1. Launch openocd in separate terminal using script provided by The Core.
    Alternatively, you can use script from `openocd` installation.

    ```
    openocd -f ~/path/to/the/core/scripts/stm32f4discovery.cfg
    ```
1. Launch `minicom` with device associated with USB <-> UART converer
    (`ttyUSB0` here used as an example).

    ```
    minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0
    ```

1. Launch `gdb` from build directory.

    ```
    arm-none-eabi-gdb exti

    # ... GDB will produce some output

    ```
1. Under GDB shell, connect to `openocd` and flash firmware.

    ```
    (gdb) target remote :3333
    Remote debugging using :3333

    (gdb) monitor reset halt

    Transfer rate: 14 KB/sec, 3762 bytes/write.

    ```

1. Start new firmware.

    ```
    (gdb) continue
    Continuing.

    ```

1. Press blue user button on the Discovery board and observe output in `minicom`.

## Expected output

Before button press:
```
Welcome to theCore
Hello, Embedded World!
```

After each button press:
```
Button pressed!
```
